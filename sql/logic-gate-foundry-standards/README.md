## Logic Gate Foundry: Enterprise SQL Standards

I don’t treat these challenges as isolated exercises. In this directory, every solution is a Logic Gate—a standardized, reusable piece of architecture built to support high-stakes strategic infrastructure.

These gates are where technical competence meets economic reality. In the Foundry, we don't just move data; we engineer the intelligence layers required to identify alpha, mitigate risk, and dictate business direction. If a query doesn't translate into a decisive market advantage, it doesn't leave the shop.

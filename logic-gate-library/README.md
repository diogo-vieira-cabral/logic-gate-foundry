## logic-gate-library

Presented as a **Logic Gate**: every solution is a standardized, reusable piece of architecture, built to support high-stakes decision-making and infrastructure.  

These gates mediate technical competence with economic reality. 
In the Foundry, we don't just move data; we engineer the intelligence layers required to identify alpha, mitigate risk, and dictate business direction.  
  
If a query doesn't translate into a concrete business utility, it doesn't belong in the library.

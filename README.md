# logic-gate-foundry
  


#### **Objective:** 

Build a technical reference for engineering data with quality, precision, and integrity.  
This repository enforces the standards required to translate raw business noise into reliable, audit-ready data assets.  
  


**Why this exists:** I don’t believe in "just writing SQL." Code is a liability; logic is the asset.  

"I treat every query as a **Logic Gate** — a controlled point of verification designed to handle structural edge cases (NULL-drifts, ties, duplicates and outliers) before they corrupt the decision-making layer.  

Even if no one ever reads this, it has served its purpose: it is the blueprint for how I ensure reliability in production environments.  
  
  
  
#### **standards & core methodology**

**Logic over Syntax:** I prioritize the _Rationale_ behind the query. Syntax is a commodity; the engineered logic that protects data lineage is the value.

**Business Accountability:** I treat code as an investment. If a logic gate doesn't move a business lever (Cash Flow, CAC, LTV), it doesn't belong in the foundry.

**Integrity:** Testing is not a separate tool; it is a habit. 

**SOP Framework:** Every pattern is a documented protocol for handling specific business contexts and data risks.  
  
  

**Directories:**

- **[logic-gate-library/](https://www.google.com/search?q=logic-gate-library/)**: The core index of SQL protocols and business impact.
 - **systems/**: Composite models (dbt/SQL) for end-to-end business cases (LTV, Churn).  
  


> **Note on Growth:** This repository is an evolving audit of my own technical standards. I treat every commit as a step toward more resilient infrastructure. It isn't just about the code—it's about building a reliable mental model for how data should behave in the wild.

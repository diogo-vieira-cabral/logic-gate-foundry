# logic-gate-foundry
  


### **Objective:** 

Build a reference system for engineering data with quality, precision, and integrity.  
This repository enforces the standards required to translate raw business noise into reliable, audit-ready data assets.  
  

**Why this exists:** Code is a liability; logic is the asset.  
Even if no one ever reads this, it has served its purpose: it is the blueprint for how I ensure quality and reliability for production environments.  
  
  
### **Standards & core methodology**

**Data Integrity**: Testing is not a separate tool; it is a habit engineered by design.  

**Business Accountability**: I treat code as an investment. If a logic gate doesn't move a business lever (Cash Flow, CAC, LTV), it doesn't belong in the foundry.  

**SOP Framework**: (Standard operating procedures) 
Every pattern is a documented protocol for handling specific business contexts and data risks.  


  
### **Directories:**

- **[logic-gate-library/](https://www.google.com/search?q=logic-gate-library/)**: The core index for SQL protocols and business impact.
- **foundry-engines/**
- **systems/** Composite models (dbt/SQL) for end-to-end business cases (LTV, Churn).  
  
  
> **Note on Growth:** This repository is an evolving audit of my own technical standards. I treat every commit as a step toward more resilient infrastructure. It isn't just about the code—it's about building a reliable mental model for how data should behave in the wild.
